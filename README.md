## Phase 1: Design and Build the Database  

### Introduction

The **Maternity Ward Database** is designed to efficiently manage information related to births, mothers, babies, medical staff, and hospital rooms. This system ensures smooth organization and tracking of essential details such as birth records, doctor assignments, baby information, and patient accommodations.

#### Purpose of the Database
This database serves as a structured and reliable solution for hospital maternity departments to:  
- **Manage birth records** including birth dates, discharge dates, and birth types (cesarean/regular).
- **Track patient information** by storing details about mothers and their babies.
- **Coordinate medical staff** by linking doctors and nurses to specific patients and rooms.
- **Monitor room availability** to efficiently allocate resources.
- **Store essential details** such as baby weight, doctor specialties, and nurse shift schedules.

#### Potential Use Cases
- **Hospital Administrators** can use this database to efficiently track births, assign staff, and manage room availability.
- **Medical Staff** can access patient information, birth details, and coordinate care.
- **Mothers** can have their information and that of their babies properly documented.
- **Management** can use the system for record-keeping, scheduling, and resource allocation.

This structured database helps streamline maternity ward operations, improving organization, patient care, and communication among all parties involved.

###  SQL Scripts  
Provide the following SQL scripts:  
- **Create Tables Script** - The SQL script for creating the database tables is available in the repository  
- **Insert Data Script** - The SQL script for inserting data to the database tables is available in the repository  
- **Drop Tables Script** - The SQL script for dropping all tables is available in the repository  
- **Select All Data Script**  - The SQL script for selecting all tables is available in the repository  
  
###  Data  
####  First tool: using [mockaro](https://www.mockaroo.com/) to create csv files
We used Mockaroo to generate realistic test data for our database entities including:
- Maternity (mothers) information
- Baby details
- Doctor records
- Nurse information
- Room data
- Birth records

Example of data generation using Mockaroo:
ðŸ“œ **[Mockaroo files](stage%201/Filesmockaroo)**
![Mockaroo Data Generation](stage%201/resources/mockaroo.png)

####  Second tool: using GenerateData files
Example of data generation using GenerateData:
ðŸ“œ **[GenerateData files](stage%201/generatedataFiles)**
![GenerateData Data Generation](stage%201/resources/generatedata.png)

####  Third tool: using text files
Additional data was imported using text files to populate the database tables:
ðŸ“œ **[Text files](stage%201/DataImportFiles/maternity.csv)**
![Text File Data Import](stage%201/resources/txt.png)

### Backup 
- Backup procedures were implemented to ensure data safety:

#### Creating backup folders with today's date:
![Backup Creation](stage%201/resources/create.png)  

#### Data backup process:

## Phase 2: Quaries
### Database Updates & Constraints

#### Data Updates

The second phase involved several important data updates to optimize the database:

1. **Discharge Date Standardization**  
   All discharge dates were updated to be exactly 3 days after the birth date, ensuring consistency in patient stays.
   
   ![Discharge Date Update](stage%202/resources/discharge_date_update.png)

2. **Room Occupancy Status**  
   Room status was updated to mark rooms as "Occupied" only when they contain two mothers, improving resource allocation.
   
   Before update:
   ![Room Status Before](stage%202/resources/room_status_before.png)
   
   After update:
   ![Room Status After](stage%202/resources/room_status_after.png)

3. **Patient Contact Information**  
   Updated contact information for specific patients when necessary, such as phone number updates.
   
   Before update:
   ![Contact Before](stage%202/resources/contact_before.png)
   
   After update:
   ![Contact After](stage%202/resources/contact_after.png)

#### Table Constraints

To maintain data integrity, the following constraints were implemented:

1. **Default Room Status**  
   Default constraint that automatically marks new rooms as "Available" when added to the database.
   
   ![Default Room Status](stage%202/resources/default_room_status.png)

2. **Mother Age Validation**  
   Check constraint that validates the mother's age is within a reasonable range when new records are inserted.
   
   ![Age Validation](stage%202/resources/mother_age_validation.png)

3. **Baby Data Validation**  
   Not-null constraint ensuring all required baby information fields are populated.
   
   ![Baby Data Validation](stage%202/resources/baby_validation.png)

### Data Cleanup Operations

Several cleanup operations were performed to maintain database quality:

1. **Historical Record Removal**  
   Deleted birth records prior to April 7, 2024 to maintain relevant data only.
   
   Before deletion:

## Conclusion

The Maternity Ward Database provides a comprehensive solution for managing hospital maternity departments. Through a well-designed data structure, targeted constraints, and powerful analytical capabilities, the system offers an efficient way to manage births, track patient information, coordinate medical staff, and optimize resource allocation.

The implementation demonstrates best practices in database design, including proper relationship modeling, constraint implementation, transaction management, and analytical query capabilities. This ensures data integrity while providing valuable insights to improve hospital operations and patient care.

## Phase 3: Integration
### Integrations with 2 different data-bases
At this stage, we have experimented integrating our system.
First, we got a pair's other data-base and according to the tables, we have created their ERD:
1. CancerPatient
Primary Key: patient_id
Foreign Keys:-

2. Department
Primary Key: department_id
Foreign Keys: -

3. OncologyStaff
Primary Key: staff_id
Foreign Keys: department_id â†’ Department(department_id)

4. Diagnosis
Primary Key: diagnosis_id
Foreign Keys: patient_id â†’ CancerPatient(patient_id)
staff_id â†’ OncologyStaff(staff_id)

5. TreatmentPlan
Primary Key: plan_id
Foreign Keys: diagnosis_id â†’ Diagnosis(diagnosis_id)

6. TreatmentSession
Primary Key: session_id
Foreign Keys: plan_id â†’ TreatmentPlan(plan_id)
staff_id â†’ OncologyStaff(staff_id)

7. SideEffectReport
Primary Key: report_id
Foreign Keys: session_id â†’ TreatmentSession(session_id)
staff_id â†’ OncologyStaff(staff_id) 

Based on the conclusions of the tables we created the ERD:
![ERD](stage%203/Images/New_ERD.png)

DSD:
   ![DSD](stage%203/Images/New_DSD.png)

Integrating the two databases into one combined database:

After we uploaded their data-base to ours, We made their tables as foreign tables in our database.
Then, we operated design actions in order to integrat both of the data-bases.
Based on the "Department" table, their data-base, we connected "Department" table primary key as a foreign key in "Doctor"&"Nurse" tables, in our data-base.
As well as the "department_id" = 7 , represents "maternity department":
Doctor table:
   ![Doctor](stage%203/Reasources/update_doctor_table.png)
Nurse table:
   ![Nurse](stage%203/Reasources/update_nurse_table.png)

Combinated ERD:
   ![ERD](stage%203/Images/Combination_ERD.png)

Combinated DSD:
   ![DSD](stage%203/Images/Combination_DSD.png)

### Views

B. Second Query of the view
Query 2:
   ![Query_2](stage%203/Reasources/my_view_query_2.png)

2. **Create second view** 
Second:
   ![Second](stage%203/Reasources/create_their_view.png)

A. First Query of the view
Query 1:
   ![Query_1](stage%203/Reasources/their_view_query_1.png)

B. Second Query of the view
Query 2:
   ![Query_2](stage%203/Reasources/their_view_query_2.png)


## Conclusion
In this phase, we successfully integrated our database with another system's medical database. We began by analyzing and modeling their schema, creating a comprehensive ERD and DSD based on their tables and relationships. Following this, we imported their database and defined their tables as foreign tables within our own system.

Using shared attributes like `department_id`, we established meaningful connections between our tables (e.g., Doctor, Nurse) and theirs (e.g., Department). This enabled seamless integration and ensured relational consistency.

Finally, we created combined ERD and DSD models to reflect the merged structure and designed two sets of viewsâ€”one from our perspective and one from theirsâ€”to enable efficient querying and data analysis across both datasets. This phase laid a solid foundation for a unified and interoperable system.
